# What and why?

<p>Over the past few years, the software development industry has witnessed
a significant shift towards the "API design first approach".
This methodology places the design of an API at the forefront of
the development process, ensuring that it receives the attention it deserves.
Consequently, code implementation is tailored to align with the established
design, resulting in a more efficient and effective API experience.</p>

<p>Adopting an API design first approach offers numerous advantages
that contribute to a more robust and user-friendly API experience.
These benefits include:</p>

1. **Enhanced flexibility:** <p>Emphasizing API design from the outset empowers developers to tailor their APIs according to specific requirements. By selecting appropriate data models, endpoints, and response structures, developers can create a more customized and optimized API.</p>
2. **Superior documentation:** <p>The API design first methodology naturally lends itself to generating comprehensive documentation. This resource not only benefits developers by offering clear guidelines on API usage, but also assists non-developers in understanding the API's functionality and potential.</p>
3. **Greater interoperability:** <p>Focusing on API design enables increased interoperability between different systems. Utilizing a standardized API description language ensures seamless integration with a variety of platforms, simplifying collaboration and streamlining the development process.</p>

## OpenAPI Specifications

<p>OpenAPI specifications serve as a standardized method for defining APIs.
Crafted in a human-readable format, these specifications facilitate various aspects of the API lifecycle,
including the generation of documentation, test cases, and even code implementation.</p>

<p>Utilizing OpenAPI specifications offers a range of advantages that
contribute to a more effective API experience, such as:</p>

- **Standardization:** <p>OpenAPI specifications are a standard, which means that they are used by many different companies and organizations. This makes it easy to share and reuse API designs, and it also means that there is a large community of people who can help with questions or problems.</p>
- **Documentation:** <p>Specifications themselves being documentation can also be used to generate documentation for APIs. This documentation can be used by developers to understand how to use the API, and it can also be used by testers to test the API.</p>
- **Code generation:** <p>Specifications can be used to generate code for APIs. This code can be used by developers to implement the API, and it can also be used by testers to test the API.</p>
- **Security:** <p>Specifications can be used to define the security model for an API. This information can be used by developers to implement the security features of the API, and it can also be used by testers to test the security of the API.</p>
- **Mocking:** <p>Specifications can be used to create mocks of APIs. These mocks can be used by developers to test the API before it is implemented, and they can also be used by testers to test the API.</p>

## How To Get Started?

<p>Instead of the traditional "write code then document",
take a step back. Define what you want to achieve.</p>

1. **Define the goals of the API:** <p>The first step is to define the goals of the API. What do you want the API to do? Who do you want to use it?</p>
2. **Design the API:** <p>Once you have defined the goals of the API, you can start to design it. This involves defining the endpoints, the data formats, and the security model.</p>
3. **Generate documentation and code:** <p>Once you have designed the API, you can generate documentation and code for it. This documentation will be used by developers to understand the API, and the code will be used to implement the API.</p>
4. **Test the API:** <p>Once you have generated documentation and code for the API, you can test it. This will help to ensure that the API is working as expected.</p>
5. **Deploy the API:** <p>Once the API has been tested and is working as expected, you can deploy it. This will make the API available to users.</p>
